Project Description: AES-DES Cryptographic Tool

The AES-DES Cryptographic Tool is a cryptographic project made in Java that leverages both the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithms to provide encryption and decryption functionality for text files.

The goal of this project is to allows users to encrypt and decrypt their sensitive text files using either the AES or DES algorithm, based on their preference and requirements. The tool will provide a secure and efficient way to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information stored in text files.
The tool incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle various scenarios, such as incorrect encryption keys, invalid file paths, or corrupted files. It provides informative error messages to assist users in resolving any issues encountered during the encryption or decryption process.
The tool also supports the generation of encryption keys for both AES and DES. Users can generate a secure key to encrypt their files, and the same key will be required for successful decryption.
